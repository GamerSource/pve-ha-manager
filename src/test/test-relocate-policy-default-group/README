Test relocate policy on services with no group.
Service 'fa:130' fails three times to restart and has a 'max_restart' policy
of 0, thus will be relocated after each start try.
As it has no group configured all available nodes should get chosen for
when relocating.
As we allow to relocate twice but the service fails three times we place
it in the error state after all tries where used and all nodes where visited
